Add `Skeleton` (`@govtechmy/myds-react/skeleton`), a loading placeholder with a `shape` of `line` (default), `circle` or `block`. It is always `aria-hidden` and stops shimmering under `prefers-reduced-motion`, showing a flat `bg-black-100` fill. `TableSkeleton` is now a `line` Skeleton: its API and animated look are unchanged, and it gains the `aria-hidden` and reduced-motion behaviour.
